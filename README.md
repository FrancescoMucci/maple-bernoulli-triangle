# Numerical verification of some results exposed in *"Summations in Bernoulli's Triangle via Generating Functions"*

This repository contains a Maple project which aims to numerically verify the value of particular summations of elements of the m-th Bernoulli Triangle. These summations and their generating functions are introduced and analyzed in the paper *"Summations in Bernoulli's Triangle via Generating Functins"*, K. Oliver and H. Prodinger, Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol. 20, 2017.

This project was done for the [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/) at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/) as part of exam *B018968 - Progettazione e Analisi di Algoritmi (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)*.
